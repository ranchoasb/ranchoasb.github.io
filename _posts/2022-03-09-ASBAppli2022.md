Hello Rancho! For those who are in 7th grade and interested in applying for next year’s ASB team, you will find the slideshow from an interest meeting that you attended. 
If you want to apply, you must have come to one interest meeting, or else we won’t accept your application. We will still have two more interest meetings during lunch in F7, so if you haven't already come, and you are interested, please come then. 
 If you have any questions, please look to the slides, or ask an ASB representative. The form for Round 1 of your application will be on the last slide. 
  Round 1 will just be looking at your grades and seeing if you have the time for ASB next year.
