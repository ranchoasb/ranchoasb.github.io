Hello Rancho! Today, we are introducing March Madness! 
Participating teams will be announced on Sunday, April 13th! You can use the blank bracket available in the library now or pick up a pre-filled one on Monday. 
 If you have a printer at home, you can use this [**Link**](https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/mml-official-bracket/ncaa-bracket-printable-march-madness-bracket-pdf)! You must turn in your complete bracket to the library no later than the end of snack on Tuesday, March 15th! 
  We will add a link to this post with updated standings once the tournament begins! Remember, the top 4 brackets win the Starbucks drink of their choice delivered during school!
