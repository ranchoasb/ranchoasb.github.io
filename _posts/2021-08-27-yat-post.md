Hello everyone! If you didnâ€™t know, the Youth Action Team is coming to Rancho on Monday! They will be running really fun activities this year! Last year they did cup stacking, spin the wheel and many other fun sports. Outside of school they have activities that impact Irvine for the better. For example beach clean ups, homeless shelter donations, food drives, and more. The first session starts September 8, but meetings will be taking place throughout the week at lunch. You can visit their website at [At This Link](https://bit.ly/3DqEaOf).
Trever, our Rancho YAT representitive, made this short video explaining some more things about YAT! [Click here for the video!](https://youtu.be/1XGBxCgWpP8)
