Hello everyone! The Rancho Art Festival is coming up this Friday, February 4th. We hope to see you there while our artists showcase their work. As a reminder, the MPR will be closed for sections of the Art Festival while it is not being used. In addition, we will be having Advisement on Friday instead of Tutorial. Artists may have to change their plans regarding this new update.
If you have applied to the festival before 1/29, check your IUSD account email at https://outlook.office365.com/mail/.
