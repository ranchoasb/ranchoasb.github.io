Due to popular demand, for May ASB is holding two game days! On May 22, the Minecraft PvP Game Day will be held.

Join other students in a tournament to prove your Minecraft skills! ASB is hosting a Hypixel Bridge tournament for Java players, and duels for Bedrock players. Winners will receive Amazon gift cards and other prizes!

Unfortunately, ASB will no longer be able to host the Game Day Discord as it is an unofficial server where ASB announcements cannot be made. We are sorry for the inconvenience, but this website will contain the most recent updates about all Rancho events and announcements. The two May Game Days are still going to be held! Minecraft is on Friday, May 21st and Among Us is held on Friday, May 28th, both from 2:45 pm to 4 pm. We hope to see you there!
