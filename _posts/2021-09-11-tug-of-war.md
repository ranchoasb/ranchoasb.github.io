Hello Rancho! This week marks the start of our Advisement class Tug of War tournament, a competition that will be held over the next month! The tournament will be in single elimination format, and the winning class will receive a trophy that will be displayed in their classroom for the entire year. It will be lots of fun, so make sure youâ€™re prepared for some friendly competition!
